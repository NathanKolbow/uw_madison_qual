# Previous UW-Madison PhD qualifying exams

This repository has copies of the exams from 2010 to 2018.

From 2010-2015, the exam proceed in two parts, and you answered (typically) two out of four questions in each part.

From 2016 onward, the exam has been split into Option A and Option B tracks. See `2018_topics_covered.pdf` for details on each track.

For logistical details, please read `2018_memo.pdf` and `2018_registration_form.pdf`.

Colloquially, you pass if you get 50+ percent and fail if you get less than a 40. If you get between 40-50, the qualifying committee discusses your case and the professors you name on your registration sheet have the opportunity to speak to your ability to do research.
